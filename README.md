# wangle

This project is really an exercise in using the nim programming language 
and some of its data-structuring libraries

wangle is a simple literate-programming tool in the style of noweb, 
which generates the documentation using Markdown formatting.

This project is also an exercise in including Doxygen documentation in the repo.

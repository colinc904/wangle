# wangle

This project started out as an exercise in using the
[nim](http://nim-lang.org) programming language and some of its
libraries. It then morphed into an exercise in
using GitHub Pages to document a project.

wangle is a simple literate-programming tool in the style of
[noweb](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb), which generates the
documentation using Markdown formatting.

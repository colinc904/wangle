NOTE: if you are reading this in the toplevel `README.md` file
of a `git` repository, note that the _real_ documentation for this 
project is generated by `doxygen`. 

You can view it online [here](https://colinc904.github.io/wangle)

If you have cloned the repo, you can generate it locally as follows:

- `make doc` in this directory
- open [this link](doc/html/index.html) in your browser

A [literate program]()
is a single file containing both source code and
documentation for some software.

`wangle` is a utility program to extract just the documentation or
just the source code as required.

# Status

This project started simply as an exercise in programming with the
[nim](http://nim-lang.org)
language. It has since grown into an exercise in using 
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
to document a project.

It works well enough to produce its own code and docs.

# How to Install

Wangle is written as a
[nimble](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble)
package, so if you have installed that, just type

`nimble install https://github.com/colinc904/wangle`

otherwise you can enter the `./src` directory and type

`nim compile wangle`

# How to Use

For now, just take a peek in `./Makefile` and `./doc/Makefile`.
You can type `wangle --help` for a quick reminder of the command syntax.

# How to Develop

DO NOT EDIT the files in the `./src` subtree! They are all automatically
generated from `./wangle.nw`.

# wangle

This project is really an exercise in using the
[nim](http://nim-lang.org) programming language and some of its
data-structuring libraries

wangle is a simple literate-programming tool in the style of
[noweb](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb), which generates the
documentation using Markdown formatting.

This project is also an exercise in including Doxygen
documentation in the repo.

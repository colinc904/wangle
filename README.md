# wangle

This project is really an exercise in using the [nim](http://nim-lang.org) programming language and ome of its data-structuring libraries

wangle is a simple literate-programming tool in the style of [noweb](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb), which generates the documentation using Markdown formatting.

This project is also an exercise in including Doxygen documentation in the repo.
